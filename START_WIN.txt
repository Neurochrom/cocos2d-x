Start a project in Windows
==========================

http://www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/how_to_start_a_new_cocos2d-x_game

Install
 git-scm (so you have git bash)  https://git-scm.com/download/win
 Visual Studio 2013 community edition  https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx
 Python 2.7.x  https://www.python.org/downloads/
 Python launcher for windows
  If you have python3.x installed you should have it, if not
  get https://bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/pylauncher/downloads
  In command line select the python version
   py -2
  If you get Requested Python version (2) not installed
  check out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27503003/py-launcher-does-not-find-my-python-2-7

IMPORTANT: put this library in a folder called cocos2d-x

Open git bash
 py --version
should give 2.7.x e.g. 2.7.6 (even with python 3.x installed)

Go to cocos2d-x and run
 py setup.py

Restart git bash. Go to cocos2d-x\tools\cocos2d-console\bin and run
 py cocos.py new NameOfGame -p com.company.nameofgame -l cpp

Copy glew32.dll, zlib1.dll and any other .dll files you might need into the directory where your
executable is generated to.

Setting up git for the new project
==================================

In git bash whilst in C:\destinationfolder_without_NameOfGame\NameOfGame do
 git init
Edit .gitignore if necessary.
Add stuff and do a commit
It's best to reference cocos as a submodule. From a windows console (cmd) do
 mklink /J cocos2d ..\cocos2d-x
 git submodule add "https://github.com/Neurochrom/cocos2d-x.git" cocos2d

// You can also use the mklinks.bat file to create the link above.

Then (you can switch to git bash for this if you want)
 git add .gitmodules
 git commit -m "Cocos2d-x as a submodule."
 git add cocos2d
 git commit --amend 


Setting up Android development
==================================

Install Android SDK, NDK, ANT. Can be the ones that come with Visual Studio 2015,
but except for ANT, standalone versions are preferred.

It's important that the Android SDK and NDK paths do not contain spaces or special
characters in them!

install Java and JDK (JRE JDK).
Fix the tools.jar problem: open administrative cmd
 cd C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_51\lib
 mklink tools.jar ..\..\jdk1.8.0_51\lib\tools.jar

In the console (can be git bash) go to the cocos2d-x directory and run
 py setup.py

input (with examples)
 NDK_ROOT
 C:\Users\pc\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\ndk-bundle
 ANDROID_SDK_ROOT
 C:\Users\pc\AppData\Local\Android\sdk
 ANT_ROOT
 C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Apps\apache-ant-1.9.3\bin

Verify that ant works from console.

Install usb driver for your device.
Enable developer mode on the device.
Verify from console via
 adb -d get-serialno

Once the project is generated
go to its proj.android subdirectory in a console and (from git bash - not from cmd) run
 py build_lib.py
 ant debug -f build.xml -Dsdk.dir=$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT
 
to install
 adb -d install ../bin/debug/android/NameOfGame-debug.apk

/// @todo - how to build release

To add/remove source files to your project modify
proj.android/Android.mk

To plainly add all needed .cpp files (with no ant tricks) the find command can be useful.

You can also use the omega.sh and omega-release.sh scripts from a bash console.
Remember to replace YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE in them with you your app name first.
